Face Recognition using OpenCV and Keras

Overview :

This project utilizes OpenCV computer vision library along with Keras for face recognition. It consists of two main components:

Image Capture:

This part of the project captures images of individuals, labels them with their respective names, and stores them for training the face recognition model.
Face Recognition: The second part involves using a webcam to identify individuals in real-time and mark their names with corresponding accuracy.
Getting Started

Prerequisites :

Python 3.x
OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)
Keras library (pip install keras)

Additional Notes :

For optimal accuracy, ensure that captured images cover various facial expressions, angles, and lighting conditions.
The trained model file (trained_model.h5) will be generated after running the train_model.py script.
You can fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters and experimenting with different neural network architectures.
